## Domain Label Scope

The files in this folder are the result of needing to make a manual call to the endpoint.  They are intended to be temporary because the App Service SDK does not currently support the required API version we need. In the future, we expect to be able to remove this folder and consolidate everything into a single web app creation file (once the required SDK changes become available).
