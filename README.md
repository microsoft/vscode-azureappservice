App Service is Azure's fully-managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that lets you
deploy and scale web, mobile, and API apps. Use the Azure App Service extension
for VS Code to quickly create, manage, and deploy your websites.

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azureappservice/wiki) for more information about Azure App Service and how to use the advanced features of the extension.**

## Installation

1. Download and install the [Azure App Service extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) for Visual Studio Code
    > If you're interested in deploying single page web apps or progressive web apps (something **without** an express server), install the [Azure Storage extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage)
2. Wait for the extension to finish installing then reload Visual Studio Code when prompted
3. Once complete, you'll see an Azure icon in the Activity Bar
    > If your activity bar is hidden, you won't be able to access the extension. Show the Activity Bar by clicking View > Appearance > Show Activity Bar
4. Sign in to your Azure Account by clicking Sign in to Azureâ€¦
    >  If you don't already have an Azure Account, click "Create a Free Azure Account"


## Deploy your first app to Azure

Once you are signed in to your Azure account and you have your app open in Visual
Studio Code, click the Create Resource button - it's
the plus icon - to create a Web App.

Select "Create App Service Web App..."

![Create resource](resources/readme/createWebApp.png)

> Tip: Be sure that your application is listening on the port provided by the PORT environment variable: `server.listen(process.env.PORT)`

1. Type a globally unique name for your Web App and press Enter. Valid characters for an app name are 'a-z', '0-9', and '-'
2. Choose your **Runtime stack**

![Activity Log](resources/readme/activityLog.png)

Once your Web App has been created, reveal the resource in the Resource explorer, right click on the Web App and select "Deploy to Web App...".

1. Select your current workspace if you have your app open already or browse to the directory containing your application code

Click **Yes** if prompted to update your configuration to run `npm install` on the target server.

![Update build notification](resources/readme/update-build-notification.png)

Once the deployment starts, you're prompted to update your workspace so that subsequent deploys from this workspace automatically deploy to the same App Service web app. Choose **Yes** to ensure your changes are deployed to the correct app - you can change this later by editing your workspace settings (in `.vscode/settings.json`).

![Always deploy notification](resources/readme/always-deploy-notification.png)

Once the deployment completes, click **Browse Website** in the prompt to view your freshly deployed website.

## Stream Your Application Logs

1. In the Azure App Service explorer, expand the app then expand **Logs**
2. Click on **Connect to Log Stream...**

![Connect to Log Stream](resources/readme/connectToLogStream.png)

3. Choose **Yes** when prompted to enable logging and restart the app
    > File logging is disabled by default and will automatically be disabled within 24 hours
4. The Visual Studio Code output window opens with a connection to the log stream

```
